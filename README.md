# Predicting-quality-of-iron-ore
During the mining operation the impurities in the iron ore is removed (measured by the % silica concentrate). In this project, I have taken the data from Kaggle where various input parameters for a froth floatation plant have been provided and the task is to predict the percent silica concentrate in the ore.
